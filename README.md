# Fine-grained Image Segmentation

This project aims to perform image segmentation at various levels of granularity in an unsupervised way. Several powerful methods exist for performing instance, semantic, and panoptic segmentation. A relatively less popular task in computer vision is object part segmentation, where the task is to identify different meaningful parts belonging to the same object. Through this thesis, we wish to perform image segmentation at a fine-grained level, i.e., segmenting the image into several perceptually similar regions, which can then be combined to achieve segmentation at a coarser level. 

This project is divided into 4 sections: concept discovery, superpixel segmentation, object localization and segmentation, and finally part segmentation.
